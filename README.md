# Pi-Ager
With a fridge, accessories and the Pi-Ager software you can build a maturity cabinet for meat yourself. The software takes over the control for exhaust air, circulating air, humidification, dehumidification, UV light, light etc.

The project is a purely private project, by meat lovers for meat lovers.
